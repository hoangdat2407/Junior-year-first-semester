# [NeurIPS 2023] DeepACO: Neural-enhanced Ant Systems for Combinatorial Optimization

ðŸ¥³ **Welcome!** This codebase accompanies the paper [*DeepACO: Neural-enhanced Ant Systems for Combinatorial Optimization*](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.14032). 

## ðŸš€ Introduction
DeepACO is a generic framework that leverages deep reinforcement learning to automate heuristic designs. It serves to strengthen the heuristic measures of existing ACO algorithms and dispense with laborious manual design in future ACO applications.

- An elegant DeepACO implementation can be found in [RL4CO](https://github.com/ai4co/rl4co) library.
- You may be interested in [ReEvo: Large Language Models as Hyper-Heuristics with Reflective Evolution](https://github.com/ai4co/LLM-as-HH). ReEvo leverages large language models to automate heuristic designs under a reflective evolution framework. It outperforms DeepACO in terms of the scalability and generality of the heuristics.
